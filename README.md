# stock-analysis
Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to make an efficient, user-friendly database of yearly stocks 
in a timely matter to find the best stock(s) to invest in for Steve and his parents to look at, at a glance.

Results: 
The stock comparison for 2017 and 2018 is that stocks "ENPH" and "RUN" were both profitable and "TERP" resulted in losses in both years. 
The execution time for the code for all years (rounding up) is the same at 1.5 seconds.

Summary: 
The advantage of refactoring a code is to assure the code is running at its optimal speed.
The disadvantages are that refactoring is more time-consuming for the developer and provides room for potential errors.
